Four months later and I have still not updated the site. gah.
Let's clean the TODO list a bit and start with modest goals.
Need a simple site to keep an online presence.
I do not have any content -> single-page, no links. kthxbai

Behold, I have started to tinker with an update to vincentsimard.com.
Sweet visual redesign, interesting article, neat css/js tricksâ€”unlikely... but stay tuned I guess.

## TODO-driven development

### Style

- Tune instead of redesign
- Fixed header similar to Google Ventures or madeinhaus.com's fixed header w/subtle shrink effect</strike>
- Whitespace
- Google Fonts: Open Sans headings, Merryweather body & logo typeface? http://www.google.com/webfonts#ReviewPlace:refine/Collection:Droid+Sans|Merriweather:300,400,700,900|Open+Sans
- Responsive design
- http://www.atomeye.com/day_jobs/inkling/
