Behold, I have started to tinker with an update to vincentsimard.com.
Sweet visual redesign, interesting article, neat css/js tricksâ€”unlikely... but stay tuned I guess.

## TODO-driven development

### Style

- Tune instead of redesign
- Fixed header similar to Google Ventures or madeinhaus.com's fixed header w/subtle shrink effect
- CSS 3D iPad w/ light/shadow effect by Tom Giannattasio
- Lots of whitespace
- Color coded primary section? Meh
- Smooth loading of nav menu (codepen.io/wearedead/pen/18)
- Google Fonts: Open Sans headings, Merryweather body & logo typeface? http://www.google.com/webfonts#ReviewPlace:refine/Collection:Droid+Sans|Merriweather:300,400,700,900|Open+Sans
- Responsive design...
